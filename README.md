About `build.zip`
=================

The whole build directory is checked in as one file called `build.zip`.
That keeps it easy to create a new build without having to git add
new files. The `./build/` directory is still git ignored.

This build is created with `./make_build.sh`.

The reason for checking in the whole build is to avoid having to run
`yarn run build` on the server since it's very CPU intensive on a cheap
shared server.
